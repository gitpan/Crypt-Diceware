NAME
    Crypt::Diceware - Random passphrase generator loosely based on the
    Diceware algorithm

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
      use Crypt::Diceware;
      my @phrase = words(4); # qw/starker call recur outlaw/

      # with alternate word lists
      use Crypt::Diceware words => { wordlist => 'Original' };
      use Crypt::Diceware words => { wordlist => 'Beale' };

DESCRIPTION
    This module generates a random passphrase of words based loosely on the
    Diceware <http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html> algorithm by
    Arnold G. Reinhold.

    A Diceware passphrase consists of a randomly selected words chosen from
    a list of over seven thousand words. A passphrase of four or five words
    is likely to be stronger than typical human-generated passwords, which
    tend to be too-short and over-sample common letters ("e") and numbers
    ("1").

    Words are selected by randomly using Data::Entropy, which is reasonably
    cryptographically strong.

USAGE
    By default, this module exports a single subroutine, "words", which uses
    the Crypt::Diceware::Wordlist::Common word list.

    An alternate wordlist may be specified:

      use Crypt::Diceware words => { wordlist => 'Original' };

    Exporting is done via Sub::Exporter so any of its features may be used:

      use Crypt::Diceware words => { -as => 'passphrase' };
      my @phrase = passphrase(4);

  words
      my @phrase = words(4);

    Takes a positive numeric argument and returns a passphrase of that many
    randomly-selected words. In a list context it will return a list of
    words, as above. In a scalar context it will return a string with the
    words separated with a single space character:

      my $phrase = words(4);

    Returns the empty list / string if the argument is missing or not a
    positive number.
